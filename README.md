# restaurants-graphql
This node.js project uses graphql to query and update a small restaurant database.

# How to Run
Use terminal to cd into the files' directory.  Run "npm install."  This will install the graphql and express dependencies.  
Next, run node index.js
Terminal will print the local port where the server will be running (I set it to port 5500).
In a web browser, browse to localhost:5500/graphql
Use queries and mutations to interact with the database.  In this repo, see the "queries.txt" file for suggested queries.
